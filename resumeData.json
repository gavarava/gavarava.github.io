Gaurav came to our team as a developer on the Oracle Web Commerce platform, but as our needs grew outside that sphere Gaurave were among the first to step up and take on the challenge.\n\nFor me particular I was also happy to see how he adopted to new culture and ways of working (in this case agile, lean and lean product development) in a great way.\n\nAll in all I found working with Gaurav a joy and I would be happy to have him in my team again.",
